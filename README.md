# Hotel-Management-System

This was my first semester university Java assignment, so a lot of the code is messy because I hadn't learned OOP at the time.

**About the Assignment**

This Java program is part of a package named Assignment1 and appears to be a command-line application for managing a hotel booking system. It allows users to perform various operations such as adding rooms, renting rooms, returning rooms, and managing room maintenance.
