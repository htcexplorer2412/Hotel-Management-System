# Hotel-Management-System

This was my first-semester university Java assignment, so a lot of the code was messy because I hadn't learned OOP at the time.

**About the Assignment**

This Java program is a command-line application for managing a hotel booking system. It allows users to perform various operations such as adding, renting, returning, and working room maintenance.
